# Plus one

#### Given a non-negative number represented as an array of digits, plus one to the number.

#### The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.

#### Tip

```
Start the operation from the last bit of the array and assign the original array first. When you encounter a situation where you need to carry one bit more than the original array, remember to rebuild the array.
